possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually endthe number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awfuljoel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that hes still capable of making a stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just cant get a good focus he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to whats actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film thats titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach its horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finishedthe acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didnt even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating 310\",\n          \"i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did the anthology stories were better than par but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself where i have i seen them before forget the running time listed on new lines tape this aint no 103 minutes according to my vcr timer and imdb space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8\",\n          \"caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office i dont go in for law suits or motions i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a fing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then im comin upstairs junior and im grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a do we have an understanding offsetting his small role however is dan acroyd who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid overall caddyshack ii is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it\"\n        ],\n
